Zip-Manager-v3
==============

This is the third rewrite of the zip-manager. Our mods are not updated from github from a php script that uses shell commands to update, zip, and sync the folders.

The manager pulls all data from the /data/options.json. This file contols what the zipmanager is capable of. It has the presets that the zipmanager uses to do its task. Also it is recommended to put all .json files that the patcher uses in the /data/ folder.
